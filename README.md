# Call_Centre_Trends_Exploration_and_Analysis
## Overview:
This project entails a comprehensive analysis of call center trends to optimize operational efficiency and enhance customer satisfaction. Leveraging advanced Excel, DAX, and Power BI, we delve into call records, examining key metrics such as call duration, satisfaction ratings, issue resolutions, and agent performance. Through meticulous analysis, we aim to uncover insights that drive strategic improvements in call center operations.

## Exploration and Analysis Approach:
In this project, we utilize advanced Excel functionalities, DAX formulas, and Power BI visualizations to dissect call center data. We analyze call volumes, satisfaction ratings, issue resolution rates, and agent performance metrics to identify trends and patterns. By employing interactive dashboards and data modeling techniques, we gain actionable insights into call center operations, facilitating informed decision-making and process optimization.

## Insights Explored:
* Satisfaction Ratings: While individual calls receive satisfactory ratings ranging between 3 and 4, the average satisfaction rating experiences a slight decline over three months, with January recording the highest at 3.45 and March the lowest at 3.37.

* Issue Resolution: January witnesses the highest percentage of resolved issues, followed by a slight dip in February and a subsequent increase in March.

* Call Timing: The majority of calls are received in the morning, highlighting peak call hours and informing resource allocation strategies.

* Agent Performance: Joe holds the record for the highest average speed of answer, while Jim maintains the highest call resolution rate despite handling more calls than average. Conversely, Becky exhibits slower speed of answer but achieves a higher rate of resolved calls, suggesting potential efficiency improvements.
